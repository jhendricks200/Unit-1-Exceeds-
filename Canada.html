          <img src="images/banff.jpg" alt="image of the town of banff" class="image">
          <p class="paragraph"> Shot Framing as displayed in this photo is utilizing your environment to frame an image. That can be done by shooting through a
          tree branch and getting leaves in the shot. In this case I was in a cable car heading up a mountain. I utlized the window of the car to capture the town of banff
        in the Canadian Rockies.</p>
